              I was thinking more along the lines of the more traditional taboos. Like a relative cousin ,aunt , uncle , brother , sister or pArent. &lt;br /&gt;
Or that you may have had a liking towards the comforting the younger. Which I don which I can handle a lady doing that. But can&#039;t take a male doing Sam thing to them. Or

              Looking at your experiences I assumed a couple of other things. But I was obviously wrong.  I would probably trade off and do yours for something you could do not sure what though.

              Yeah eating there cum I am not into but have done before. And being pegged I assume that is putting a strap on and taking my rear. I have also done that before and didn&#039;t mind it but didn&#039;t do much for me.

              Im not sure if you are into it but I  loved pegging my ex-boyfriend. &lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes being with another man while he watched was fun. Making him eat the other guys cum out of me was awesome.

              Yes it seems to work that way. You seem like you would be kinky enough for me too. Hey can I ask what is the taboo you fantasise about or have done. I think I know already and don&#039;t mind that at all but was just asking anyway.

              I do have a parrot a cockatoo in fact and no I am not married I do have a girlfriend at the moment. I love having gangbangs and public sex and having my partners dress and act slutty but do all with us both involved. But it sometimes leads to partners eventually wanting to do other things or settle down unfortunately
