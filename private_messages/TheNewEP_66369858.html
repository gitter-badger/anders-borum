              We would like you to know that a &#039;New Experience Project&#039; is on the way!: http://SimilarWorlds.com&lt;br /&gt;
Many THOUSANDS of EP members have joined already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The new site will have the current features of EP, but also many notable improvements.&lt;br /&gt;
It is a Safer place, made for connecting with those who share similar Stories and Experiences to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please visit the link to register! http://SimilarWorlds.com&lt;br /&gt;
We should be launched by or before the day EP closes (April 21st ).&lt;br /&gt;
Best Regards!

              Hi extremesexmic!&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m guessing you&#039;ve heard the news, that this site will be closing very soon.
