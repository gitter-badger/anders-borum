              A word of advice don&#039;t settle down until at least 25 but 28-30 would be better. That&#039;s kids marriage long term commitments prior to then you are still to young still figuring things out. So to speak if you know someone who would like to adopt the kid by all means go ahead but realistically until born they are non existent many miscarriage ect still born. So fell no guilt or pain if you choose to terminate. The less people you tell the better. Then say you had an accident or something to those who know. But don&#039;t bring it into a world of desperation or torture. It needs love and 18 years of attention and devotion.
