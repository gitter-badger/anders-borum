Unless he has decided to totally destroy something. The garage door opener coped it yesterday. Lol. He&#039;s still very young he should out love me and my children.&amp;nbsp;

  He&#039;s cute.. My Aunt has an African Gray Parrot. He is hysterical! When someone knocks on her door he says, &quot;Coming!!&quot; in her voice- even when she&#039;s NOT home. Her neighbors almost called the cops recently thinking something was wrong until one realized her car wasn&#039;t outside and it was probably her parrot. Lol
