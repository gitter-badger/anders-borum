                        I would love to hear what are your deepest and most hidden desires are. I  have a large variety of fantasies but most I enjoy and have either tried or watched partners do they generally ba&lt;x&gt;se themselves now on my sexual preferences and extend on from experiences already had.

  I think it&#039;s natural for fantasies to grow from one to the next. Mine do. What I&#039;m interested in today isn&#039;t all that different from what I was interested in yesterday, and what I&#039;ll be interested in tomorrow won&#039;t be that different from what I&#039;m interested in today. And yet my fantasies keep changing all the time. A lot of the time they change based on what I see or hear from someone else, and I think, I like that. Or, I want to try that. Or, that&#039;s really cool and sexy, but it would be even sexier if I changed this, or added that. And that&#039;s how I get tomorrow&#039;s fantasies.

  I thought that was a given for a transvestite well until you took the next leap and you  have the ball and chain gang cut and tucked.
